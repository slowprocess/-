Modal professes this to be a project with deep personal meaning—a cathartic expression, a tribute of sorts. The compositions shift moods between contemplative, melancholy and at times downright horrifying, with abstract synths, guitars and sound effects abound. The first full-length album on Slow Process, “L.M.” will be released on special edition cassette and digital formats.
